      We are terribly sorry to say that due to the delay in and loss of funding
      some key sponsors, we have no choice but to cancel the 2019 JGM Memorial
      Soccer Tournament. This event and the cause that it stands for are very
      near and dear to our hearts and we are deeply saddened that we have to
      cancel. All players will be granted a full refund for their registration
      payment. We humbly appreciate all of the love and support you have all
      given us here at UGC, and we hope to see the same great support when it
      comes to our next event. We sincerely apologize for any and all
      inconveniences this may have caused and we hope you are all enjoying your
      summers!
